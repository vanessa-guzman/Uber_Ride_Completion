# Uber Ride Completion

**Tools:** RStudio, R, Tableau, Google Slides <br />
**R Packages:** tidyverse, lubridate <br />
**Skills:** data cleaning, data wrangling, data analysis, data visualization <br />
**Objective:** Examine why Uber has a large amount of unfulfilled requests and deliver recommendations. <br />
<br />
**About the data:** The data contained information about Uber ride requests (e.g. status, pickup timestamp) and was collected between July 11, 2016 and July 16, 2016. The data can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalraicha/uber-request-data). <br />
<br />

* Converted dates from string format to datetime format using parse_date_time() and guess_formats()
* Created new columns to use during analysis 
* Provided descriptive statistics of rides
* Analyzed ride status by location and day of week
* Analyzed ride duration by location and day of week
* Created simple visualizations using ggplot()

**Deliverables:**
